# text-generator
# Text Generation Model
This code represents a text generation model based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) with GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layers. The model is trained on the "Harry Potter" book series.
# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (version X.X.X)
- Transformers library (version X.X.X)
- Other dependencies (specified in requirements.txt)

# Model Usage
- After training, the model weights are loaded from the latest checkpoint.
- The generate_text function is used to generate new text based on a given starting string.
- The function generates a specified number of characters by sampling from the model's predictions.
- The generated text is returned as output.



# Usage
1. Make sure you have the required version of TensorFlow installed.
2. Execute the code to train the model and generate text.
